# ChitsUI
## App
The app.module.ts is reponsible for bootstrapping the Angular application. Here we inject all of the dependent modules, services,
and components.

#### Routes

We also define the routes for the SPA here and their related components as follows:
* /home => HomeComponent
* /howitworks => WorksComponent
* /joinus => JoinComponent
* /groups => GroupsComponent
* /contactUs => ContactComponent
* /aboutUs => AboutComponent
* /login  => LoginComponent

###### (notice a pattern...?)
